# SHADERS
I added a duplicate of the Roblox.exe executable that enables both Bloom and Depth of Field shaders. To use them,
you must switch to the OpenGL graphics mode.

There are two versions of OpenGL included: Stable and Experimental. I recommend using Stable, however I have not
tested Experimental as of writing this (4/29/2024 @ 3:06 PM, UTC -8:00)
